# Data Bricks Lab - Week 6


Going over some of the learning from the lab of exploring databricks. 


DataBricks is a versatile tool that utilizes cloud computing to be more powerful, faster and secure in running code. 

We could choose one of Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud. for the puprose of this lab we used AWS. 

In terms of applications, Databricks has two suites. Data Science/Engineering and Machine Learning. So very powerful in terms of usage cases however we only explored the Data Science version. 

As we can see below, the DS version is used for running queries and data cleaning/processing.

Finally, we imported a prepared notebook and ran some Koalas/Python queries within. Also worth mentioning that you can run different languages in the platform
